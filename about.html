    <p>
      TWRP is an elite squad of rockstars from the future originally crash landing in Halifax, Nova Scotia. They are currently based in Toronto, on a mission to spread fun and eliminate boredom across the universe. <br /><br />Current stop: Earth, <br /><br />Current
      Continent: North America.

      <!-- <h1>Doctor Sung</h1> -->
      <ul float="right">
        <li>
          <h3>Name: Doctor Sung</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Instrument: Vocals, Keytar, Talkbox</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Occupation: Musical Warrior</h3>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hailing from the Fifth Dimension, Sung's parents both died when he was young. The cause of their death was sheer boredom, thus sparking Doc's hatred for it. He then decided it was his purpose to eradicate boredom, sadness and opression from
        every corner of the multiverse. This quest led him and his bandmates to Earth.

      <!-- <h1>Commander <br /> Meouch</h1> -->
      <ul float="right">
        <li>
          <h3>Name: Commander Meouch</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Instrument: Bass</h3>

        <li>
          <h3>Occupation: Space Pirate</h3>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Prior to joining TWRP, Meouch made a fortune as a space pirate, smuggling funk to “historically square” star systems. He is also responsible for destroying Lord Phobos’ home world and civilization. Meouch has been called the sassiest member
        of TWRP by his bandmates. He also has a deep-seeded mistrust of journalists, as evidenced in Dave Hurlow’s account of his time spent with the band.

      <img src="./assets/images/Lord_Phobos.png" width="300" height="300" float="left" />
      <!-- <h1>Lord Phobos</h1> -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Name: Lord Phobos</h3>

        <li>
          <h3>Instrument: Guitar</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Occupation: Rocketeer</h3>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Phobos is a philosophical rocketeer from a race of scientific and culturally advanced people several millennia in the future. His civilization was destroyed by Commander Meouch, possibly when he smuggled funk to the people. Enraged and
        hungry for revenge, Lord Phobos pursued Meouch into space. The conflict between the two was pacified when Doctor Sung exited a worm hole into the middle of the battle. For reasons unspecified, Phobos took a sacred vow of silence. Phobos
        often practices guitar scales from the top of the CN tower in Toronto. He is a fan of the major league baseball team The Toronto Blue Jays.

          <h3>Name: Havve Hogan</h3>

        <li>
          <h3>Occupation: Prehistoric Cyborg</h3>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Havve Hogan was first discovered, unconscious, by Doctor Sung in the Mesozoic Period. Sung successfully resuscitated Havve by replacing his heart with an 808 drum. Havve became a member of Tupper Ware Remix Party when Doctor Sung, Lord
        Phobos, and Commander Meouch traveled through time to the Mesozoic Period and picked him up.
