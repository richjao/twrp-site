      Doctor Sung is the frontman of Tupper Ware Remix party who plays keytar, synthesizer, and performs vocals though the use of an effects box known as a talkbox. He wears a yellow morphsuit with a black stripe that runs vertically along his sides, and a black stripe going across his lower abdomen. His eyes are obscured by an orange helmet that resembles a traffic cone or pylon with a visor. Sung is highly energetic and active both on stage and off. He often performs high kicks and displays feats of skill with his nunchaku. Doctor Sung comes from the 5th Dimension. He was born 13.5 billion years ago in the superheated cosmic gasses of the big bang.[3,5] His parents died of boredom when he was just a child, leaving him orphaned during the first Ice Age.[5] Several billion years later, during the Mesozoic period, Sung followed a strong energy field to cave where he discovered Havve Hogan.[5] This story conflicts with a 2016 Reddit AMA where it is explained that Doctor Sung and Havve Hogan met at drum camp when he was 16 and began playing keyboard some time around then.[7] Some unspecified amount of time later, Doctor Sung traveled through a wormhole which put him right in the center of a vicious fight between Lord Phobos and Commander Meouch. After pacifying the fight between the two, Sung modified Meouchâ€™s ship for time travel and together, the three traveled to the past to pick up Havve.[5] No further information about his childhood, adolescence, or adult life is known. Doctor Sung is a Doctor of Experimental High Kicks, and holds a 69th degree black belt in keytar.[5,7] He maintains a passionate relationship with his instrument and prefers to play standing up.[4] In 2012, around the same time the band moved to Toronto, Sung began practicing the Nunchaku.
